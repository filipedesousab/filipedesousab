### Hi!
I'm a software developer for fun and a gardener by profession. Or the reverse.\
I'm not an enemy of any technology, but I am a Ruby on Rails enthusiast.

##### I also like:
- Well written software :octocat:
- The pleasure of solving a problem :heavy_check_mark:
- Enjoy my family :family:
- Walk with my dog, Cometa :dog2:
- Travel and camping :sunrise_over_mountains:

##### My wishes:
- A DeLorean to go back in time
- Hack satellites like Matt from Live Free or Die Hard
- Search for a planet, on a starship Enterprise, that has a colony of hobbits to vacation on

My github seems to be messed up, but the truth is, I didn't want to erase my past. Who knows, maybe in the near future a good repository will appear to collaborate with the community?

To contact by email:\
`whois filipebotelho.com | grep -i 'Admin Email'`
