### Hi!
I'm a software developer for fun and a gardener by profession. Or the reverse.\
I'm not an enemy of any technology, but I am a Ruby on Rails enthusiast.

##### I also like:
- Well written software <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HolyZheng/holyZheng-blog/master/images/coding.gif" width="30" alt="coding cat">
- The pleasure of solving a problem :heavy_check_mark:
- Enjoy my family :family:
- Walk with my dog, Cometa :dog2:
- Travel and camping üèïÔ∏è

##### My wishes:
- A DeLorean to go back in time
- Hack satellites like Matt from Live Free or Die Hard
- Search for a planet, on a starship Enterprise, that has a colony of hobbits to vacation on

##### Affective relationships ‚ù§Ô∏è:

My github seems to be messed up, but the truth is, I didn't want to erase my past. Who knows, maybe in the near future a good repository will appear to collaborate with the community?

To contact by email:\
`whois filipebotelho.com | grep -i 'Admin Email'`
